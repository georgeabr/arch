# Script for installing Arch linux to disk

Bash script to install Arch linux on disk. Flavoured with XFCE.  
- UEFI, root and swap partitions required (may be unformatted, except for UEFI, which should already be formatted).  
- UEFI partition should already exist and be formated, because of interoperability with Windows and other Linux distributions.
